Lab 1: Getting used to Javadoc

In this lab you are simply going to produce appropriate Javadoc for
various program pieces, using the Whatever example as a guide.

You will produce appropriate Javadoc comments for each of the
interfaces Fraction.java and Tank.java as well as the exception
class DivideByZeroRuntimeException.

This means you will put in appropriate comments and, then, running
Javadoc in order to produce the html files. Take the default spot
(doc) that Dr Java produces to store the html and, then, open the
file index.html in your favorite browser to look at the result.
Keep messing until you (and the TA or instructor) like the resulting
html display in your browser.
