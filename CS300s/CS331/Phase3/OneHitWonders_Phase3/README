Imad, please for the sake of all that is good, please put extract me into your Desktop! Otherwise you risk everything that is good!

You will want to run the setupDatabase.sql to load up all the proper tables, views, triggers, procedures, functions, events, and data into our schema.

I should look like this when run from the source command of mysql.

source ~/Desktop/OneHitWonders_Phase3/setupDatabase.sql
