	Edward L. Parrish]</p>
	<p><u><b><font size="5">What is a team?</font></b></u></p>
	<p>A team is a <i>small group</i> of people with <i>complimentary skills</i> who are 
	committed to a <i>common purpose, goals and approach</i> for which they hold 
	themselves and each other <i>accountable</i>. Let's explore each part of this 
	definition to fully understand it. </p>
	<h3>Small Group Size</h3>
	<p>Teams usually work best with a small group of people. Smaller numbers 
	make team <i>administrative tasks easier</i>, such as deciding where and when to 
	meet. <i>Meetings are generally shorter</i> when fewer people need to speak. Small 
	size also makes it easier to <i>develop a common purpose</i> with mutual goals and 
	mutual accountability, which is so important for good teamwork. In addition, 
	a small group of people <i>avoids the &quot;herd&quot; mentality </i>of large groups. In a 
	large group people tend to go along with popular opinion rather than 
	thinking for themselves. In general, the larger the group of people, the 
	harder it is for the group to work well together. </p>
	<h3>Complimentary Skills <span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: italic">
	[limited control over this in this class]</span></h3>
	<p>Complimentary skills are also important for a team. Necessary skills 
	include: technical, problem-solving, decision-making and interpersonal 
	skills. Technical skills are needed to provide the expertise to meet the 
	goals of the team. The other skills are necessary for the team to work 
	effectively together. </p>
	<h3>Commitment</h3>
	<p>High performance teams must make a strong commitment to a common purpose 
	and goals. A common, meaningful purpose sets the tone and aspirations of the 
	team. The team's purpose must then be translated into specific, measurable 
	goals, often called milestones. The milestones help to focus the team and 
	make it more productive. Meeting milestones also gives the team small 
	victories that are crucial to its commitment and morale. This combination of 
	purpose and goals is important for the success of the team. </p>
	<h3>Common Approach <span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: italic">[will 
	learn quite a bit on this class as we go along]</span></h3>
	<p>The members of a real team must also make a commitment to a common 
	approach. What are the <i>standards</i> of behavior? How will the team go about its 
	tasks? Who will perform which task? How will schedules be assigned and how 
	are decisions made? These are the nuts-and-bolts issues that need to be 
	agreed upon by all members of the team.</p>
	<h3>Accountability <span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: italic">
	[common ownership]</span></h3>
	<p>The members of the team must also share a sense of mutual accountability. 
	In other words, they must <i>hold themselves and each other answerable for 
	meeting the team's goals</i>. All of them must know what they are responsible 
	for both individually and as a team. </p>
	<h2><u>Why have teams?</u></h2>
	<p>Teams are <i>commonplace in industry today</i>. Most companies organize their 
	employees by function, such as engineering, finance and marketing. Even 
	within a function such as engineering, people are usually organized into 
	smaller groups by their specialties. Companies then use teams when people 
	from different groups are needed to meet a goal, such as developing a new 
	product. Some of the reasons for organizing a group of people as a team, 
	instead of a committee or other group structure, are shown below. </p>
	<h3>Enhanced Cooperation and Coordination</h3>
	<p>With tasks that need cooperation and coordination, teams can perform 
	better than individuals or functional groups. Cross-functional teams reduce 
	the number of hand-offs and the amount of coordination needed between the 
	functions: because more of the expertise to do the job belongs to the team, 
	there is less need to pass work on to another group. This improved 
	coordination can provide strategic advantages to companies such as reduced 
	time to market. </p>
	<h3>Synergy</h3>
	<p>Teamwork is more than getting along or being helpful. In a real team the 
	members work toward a common goal. By working together, team members help 
	each other to accomplish tasks. A team working together usually gets more 
	results in less time than other types of organizations. </p>
	<h3>Organizational Flexibility</h3>
	<p>An organization can be more flexible by using teams. Management can put a 
	team together to accomplish a specific task and then disbanded it. Or, a 
	team can be kept together more or less permanently to address an ongoing 
	need such as running an operation or developing a series of new products.
	</p>
	<h3>Organizational Parity</h3>
	<p>One of the advantages of cross-functional teams is that they serve as a 
	way to prevent any one group from having higher status than another has. In 
	a hierarchically managed organization, there is a tendency for one group to 
	have more status than other groups. The groups with lower status often have 
	their ideas and suggestions discounted. This tends to limit the number of 
	creative ideas and problem-solving options to those produced by the 
	high-status group. In contrast, teams allow each member to have an equal say 
	in decisions and discussions. By considering all ideas and proposals 
	equally, teams can produce more creative and optimum results. </p>
	<h3>Job Satisfaction</h3>
	<p>Another advantage of teams is that <i>people generally derive more 
	satisfaction from their jobs</i>. When team members work together to overcome 
	obstacles that stand in their way, they <i>derive satisfaction not only from 
	achieving the goal but also from the trust and confidence they build in 
	other team members</i>. The enjoyment is heightened even further because they 
	can see that they are taking part in something larger than what they can 
	accomplish by themselves. </p>
	<h2><u>Common Phases of Team Development</u></h2>
	<p>Teams often go through steps or phases during their development. There 
	are many ways to describe these phases, but perhaps the best known are: 
	<i>forming</i>, <i>storming</i>, <i> <span class="SpellE">norming</span></i> and 
	<i>performing</i>. These 
	terms were developed by Bruce <span class="SpellE">Tuckman</span> in 1965
	<a href="http://www.soe.ucsc.edu/classes/cmps115/Spring01/staff/teams.html#1">
	(1)</a> to describe how the members of small groups tend to act as the team 
	develops. Each phase is described below. </p>
	<h3>Forming</h3>
	<p>This phase occurs when a team first comes together, or when membership 
	changes. Sometimes this phase is called the <i>&quot;honeymoon&quot; period
	</i>because 
	everyone is so nice to each other. Team members are usually <i>cautious and 
	polite </i>with each other, while exploring their new circumstances. A good way 
	to expedite this phase is to have &quot;icebreaker&quot; activities that allow team 
	members to understand each member's capabilities and motivations. </p>
	<h3>Storming</h3>
	<p>During this phase, team members <i>begin challenging and disagreeing with 
	one another</i>. They often jockey for position and use their expertise as 
	weapons. <i>Teams can get stuck in this phase and then fail</i>. They key to moving 
	quickly through this phase is explicitly defining the roles and 
	responsibilities of each team member. </p>
	<h3><span class="SpellE">Norming</span></h3>
	<p>In this phase, team members start <i>offering ideas and suggestions</i>, 
	sometimes using humor to get their points across. They r<i>eveal their 
	preferences for performing tasks</i>. Standards of behavior and team processes 
	are defined. By defining team processes, one can move on to performing. </p>
	<h3><font size="3">Performing</font></h3>
	<p>This phase is the <i>ideal phase for a team</i>. They <i>work hard and play hard 
	together</i>, using humor to help ease tensions. Team members anticipate 
	problems, changes in direction and each other's moves. <i>The focus of the team 
	is on accomplishing their goals and not on blaming each other</i>. </p>
	<h3>Optimal Team-Development Steps</h3>
	<p>While these team-development steps are well known, there is no need for a 
	team to have a storming phase. Even though storming is a common part of team 
	development, it is not a desirable or productive time. Your team can <i>bypass 
	the storming phase by</i> clarifying the team's mission; defining goals and 
	milestones; establishing roles and responsibilities; and creating processes 
	for getting the work done. These steps are described in the following 
	sections. </p>
	<h2><font size="4">Clarifying the Mission</font></h2>
	<p><i>The mission is the purpose of the team and the reason it exists</i>. 
	<i>Understanding the mission includes understanding the product the team will 
	produce</i>. The team will make a detailed description of the product for the 
	mission using the requirements specification document </p>
	<h2><font size="4">Defining Goals and Milestones
	<span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: italic">[I will provide those as 
	we go along]</span></font></h2>
	<p>A goal is the end toward which effort is directed and milestones are 
	significant points in development
	<a href="http://www.soe.ucsc.edu/classes/cmps115/Spring01/staff/teams.html#2">
	(2)</a>. Project milestones help to define a project in greater detail and 
	are a useful way to track team progress. In this course, the team's goal is 
	to produce the banking system described by your professor.</p>
	<h2><font size="4">Establishing Roles and Responsibilities</font></h2>
	<h3><font size="3">Defining Roles and Responsibilities</font></h3>
	<p>A role is a function or part performed for a position in an organization. 
	Roles are present whether we are aware of them or not, and it is <i>better to 
	choose and assign the roles on a team rather than just let them happen. Each 
	role has a set of responsibilities associated with the role. Responsibility 
	means being answerable for performing the duties and tasks</i>. </p>
	<p>The roles of team members, with the associated responsibilities for those 
	roles, are dependent upon the project and the expertise of the team member. 
	Teams often have members from different organizations and the team member's 
	role is to contribute that organization's expertise to the project. </p>
	<p>As you can see, the division of the roles depends on the project, the 
	skills of each team member, and an understanding of how to fairly divide the 
	work of developing the product. Thus it is a good idea to discuss the roles 
	of each team member after selecting the product and while deciding on the 
	major sub-sections of the design. Then each team member will have the 
	responsibility for the design and implementation of a sub-section of the 
	product. </p>
	<h3><font size="3">Other Team Member Responsibilities</font></h3>
	<p>There are <i>some responsibilities that are common to all team member</i>s. 
	These responsibilities exist because the team needs to work together to 
	accomplish its goals. These responsibilities are based on the need for 
	cooperation. As a memory aid, I have organized the responsibilities for good 
	cooperation under the headings of follow through, assertiveness, 
	communication, timeliness and spirit. Together the first letters of these 
	headings spell FACTS, F-A-C-T-S. I call them the FACTS of teamwork. <i>Team 
	members have a responsibility to enhance cooperation on their team using 
	these FACTS</i>. </p>
	<h4><i>Follow through</i></h4>
	<p>When team members cooperate, they follow through on commitments. With 
	this follow-through, the member shows a keen awareness that a<i>s part of a 
	team, everything they do affects someone else</i>. They also know that if they 
	<i>forget to do something, they become a weak link; an obstacle in the work 
	process</i>. Lack of follow-through impedes the performance of others and 
	<i>reduces trust</i>. It is hard to trust people who do not do what they say they 
	will do. </p>
	<p>Other team members may interpret lack of follow-through as a <i>lack of 
	respect for others</i>. This seems obvious since it is tiresome to &quot;remind&quot; 
	adult colleagues that something is due, and annoying to sit through meetings 
	where people offer excuses about why things did not get done. When 
	individuals don't do what they say, it is demoralizing and leads to a rather 
	contagious lack of effort. On the other hand, when team members keep 
	commitments, they inspire their colleagues to do the same. </p>
	<h4><i>Assertiveness</i></h4>
	<p>A team member has a responsibility to <i>speak frankly and openly when there 
	is a difference of opinion</i>. A team is more likely to succeed when members 
	are willing to risk conflict with other team members and stand their ground 
	when required. This helps the team to a<i>void making bad decisions and then 
	implementing them because everyone went along just to be part of the team</i>.
	</p>
	<p>At the same time, a team member <i>must not become so dedicated to their 
	position that they ignore the team's purpose and goals</i>. Members should show 
	flexibility, an <i>ability to meet halfway</i>, and a willingness to <i>work for the 
	common good</i>. Team members should <i>negotiate their differences </i>so that both 
	parties can win. In highly cooperative teams, there are few turf wars, 
	little competitiveness, and an ability to forgive and forget. </p>
	<h4><i>Communication</i></h4>
	<p>For a team to reach its full potential, team members must be willing to 
	<i>say what they think</i>, <i>ask for help</i>, <i>share new or unpopular ideas</i>, g<i>ive the 
	status of their activities</i>, and <i>risk admitting mistakes</i>. This can only 
	happen in a setting where team members show concern for one another, trust 
	one another, and look for answers together. When communication is friendly, 
	open and positive, teams are more productive and team members feel more 
	satisfied. </p>
	<p>Friendly interaction happens when people know each other, respect each 
	other, and show warmth toward one another. Such behaviors provide an 
	atmosphere for risk taking and cooperation. When team members ask each other 
	about their lives outside of work, share jokes, and on the whole make each 
	other feel welcome, they are creating conditions for group bonding. </p>
	<p><i>Open, honest communication is key to a team's success</i>. Nothing reduces 
	trust faster than when members say one thing within the group and something 
	else outside of the group. When people are confident enough to say what they 
	need to say directly to the right people, and to <i>refrain from talking behind 
	each other's back</i>, they enhance trust. </p>
	<h4><i>Timeliness</i></h4>
	<p class="MsoNormal">Attention to timeliness, which is <i>doing things at the 
	right time</i>, is also a responsibility of team members. When members are 
	cooperating well, they respect each other's time and schedules. People s<i>how 
	up on time for appointments</i>; meetings begin and end on time. They <i>return 
	emails as promised</i>. There is a sense of <i>urgency</i> about team tasks, 
	reflecting a willingness to make the team's actions a top priority. </p>
	<p>Members share important information promptly and succinctly. People ask 
	each other for comments on their plans and ideas often, but not so often 
	that it blocks the workflow. <i>Team members tend to cluster their questions 
	and comments so that they share them all at once instead of repeatedly 
	interrupting each other's workday</i>. </p>
	<p>People <i>know each other's calendars and schedule</i> important group 
	activities so that everyone can attend. You might also hear people <i>
	thanking</i> each other for their time and asking, &quot;Is this a good time?&quot; It 
	is hard not to cooperate with those who respect your time. </p>
	<h4><i>Spirit</i></h4>
	<p>Being on a team is a bit like being part of a family. You can't have your 
	way all of the time. To make the team perform, all members must have a 
	<i>tolerant spirit</i>. </p>
	<p>When teamwork is high in a group, you can sense the positive attitude. 
	Members value individual differences, speak kindly about individual talents, 
	offer compliments on individual contributions -- but also form a team 
	identity. Members develop mutual trust, talk openly, and willingly welcome 
	new members as needed. </p>
	<p>When there is good team spirit, <i>members make decisions by consensus, not 
	by voting</i>. Voting divides a team into winners and losers, whereas consensus 
	requires each team member to cooperate. Team members must listen to each 
	point of view, modify his or her own stand to fit the will of the group, and 
	support the decision that seems best for the team. </p>
	<p>When team spirit is high, parties are frequent and often spontaneous. 
	Members may recognize special occasions such as birthdays or weddings, 
	individual successes such as solving a vexing problem, or team successes 
	such as reaching a project milestone. Recognition on such occasions may be 
	as informal as someone bringing snacks or pizza to meetings, or as formal as 
	presenting framed certificates. The congratulations are always sincere, 
	however, and the message is very clear: &quot;We celebrate each other's 
	milestones and successes because we are all on the same team. <i>A win for one 
	is a win for all</i>.&quot; Such camaraderie is a good sign that teamwork within the 
	group is high. </p>
	<h3><font size="3">The Team Leader</font></h3>
	<p>Why does a team need a leader? <i>Someone needs to look at the big picture: 
	the project or milestone as a whole</i>. This allows the other team members to focus on their 
	parts of the project knowing that someone is thinking about how everything 
	fits together. </p>
	<p>Teams on large projects generally have full-time leaders. However for 
	this course, every student must go through all the steps of the development 
	process themselves. Therefore, a full-time team leader is not possible. Each team 
	must rotate 
	leadership during the project and allow everyone to gain some experience in 
	the team-leader's role. If your team decides to rotate leadership, then the 
	project milestones are a good place to change leadership. The current leader 
	has the responsibility to guide the team in reaching their next milestone.
	</p>
	<h4><i>Team Leader's Role</i></h4>
	<p>Team leaders are not like &quot;traditional&quot; bosses. <i>The team does not work 
	for the team leader; the team leader works for the team</i>. The role of the 
	team leader is to lead the people and manage the resources of the team to 
	meet the team's goals. <i>Leadership is the ability to get people to do what 
	needs to be done in such a way that they like it</i>. </p>
	<p>Team leader skills can be learned over time. The most important thing 
	that the team leader cans do to ensure their success in the role is to 
	believe in the team's purpose and understand the capabilities of the team's 
	members. The stronger this belief and understanding, the more easily a team 
	leader can overcome a lack of skills or training. </p>
	<p>No matter how much you know or how skilled you are, it's an obvious fact 
	that people will respond better to your leadership if they like you than if 
	they don't like you. The ability to make people like you is one of the most 
	valuable talents you can possibly develop. It makes all your other talents 
	more productive. </p>
	<p>So what makes people like you? Good humor, kindness and. appreciation of 
	people's interests and feelings. Understanding that they are just as 
	important to themselves as you are to yourself. Fairness in considering 
	their interests as well as your own. Complete lack of snobbishness toward 
	those of lesser authority. </p>
	<h4><i>Team Leader's Responsibilities</i></h4>
	<p>The main responsibilities of the team leader are as follows: </p>
	<h5>Keep the purpose, goals and process meaningful</h5>
	<p>A team leader should help team members clarify and commit to their 
	purpose, goals and processes. At the same time, it's important that the team 
	leader's suggestions not come across as mandates. Sometimes the best 
	approach is to sit quietly and let the other team members solve the 
	problems. </p>
	<h5>Monitor the performance of the team</h5>
	<p>The team leader must monitor actual performance of the team in meeting 
	its goals. When necessary, the team leader must force the team to make 
	decisions and change strategies to ensure their success. </p>
	<h5>Build commitment and confidence in the team members</h5>
	<p>Intimidation might work in a hierarchy, but it will kill enthusiasm in a 
	team. Team leaders need to focus on positive reinforcement. When a negative 
	event must occur to ensure the success of a team goal, such as moving tasks 
	from an underperforming member to someone better suited, the leader must 
	approach the situation with tact and understanding to prevent demoralization 
	of team members. </p>
	<h5>Manage relations with outsiders</h5>
	<p>The leader must have the courage to stand up for the team and to take 
	action to remove obstacles. This includes obtaining resources for the team. 
	The leader must be able to communicate the team's goals and act on behalf of 
	the team to anyone who can help the team or who might get in the way. </p>
	<h5>Create opportunities for team members</h5>
	<p>Good leaders don't keep all the good jobs for themselves, nor do they 
	take all the credit. Decisions should be made to help the team's 
	performance, no the leader's ego. </p>
	<h5>Do real work</h5>
	<p>Every team member must do roughly equal amounts of work and that includes 
	the team leader. Often times the leader must set an example by volunteering 
	to do jobs that none else wants to do. </p>
	<h2><font size="4">Creating Processes</font></h2>
	<p>For a team to work efficiently, it needs a standard way of operating. By 
	defining processes, team members know how to accomplish team tasks and they 
	spend more time working on problems that contribute to the goal of producing 
	the team's product. Some of the processes that a team needs to agree upon 
	are as follows: </p>
	<p><i>Standards of behavior:</i> Set some clear rules for behavior. These 
	rules should promote focus, openness, trust and commitment. Following these 
	rules can prevent conflicts from other members from getting in the way of 
	team tasks. They can also help people keep focused on the real work of the 
	team, which is finding solutions to problems. </p>
	<p><i>Team communication:</i> How will you keep each other informed of 
	progress? When does the team need to meet and when are other communication 
	methods, like email, appropriate? These questions and more need answering by 
	the team. </p>
	<p><i>Making decisions:</i> What decisions can individuals make and what 
	decisions must the team make? Will the team decide actions by voting or 
	consensus? My recommendation is to make decisions by consensus, not by 
	voting. Voting divides a team into winners and losers, whereas consensus 
	requires each team member to cooperate. However, the team needs to 
	consciously decide how they will make decisions. </p>
	<p>These are basic processes common to most teams. Other processes depend 
	upon the team and the project. Develop these processes as the need arises to 
	improve the efficiency of the team. </p>
