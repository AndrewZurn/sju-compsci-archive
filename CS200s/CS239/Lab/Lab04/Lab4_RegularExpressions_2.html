<h1>CS239&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lab3 ...Regular Expressions_2_
(Continued)</h1>
The regular expressions we have been studying (also called Extended
Regular Expressions) exist in two other places in Unix - in the command
line editor called sed and in the pattern matching languages awk and
Perl. sed allows you to quickly make changes in a text file while awk
and Perl allow you to write general programs (as in Java) with an
emphasis on pattern recognition and I/O.<br>
<br>
We will spend our time on Perl. Perl was originally designed as a
language to build shell scripts. A shell script is a way to build up
new Unix command line commands by creating a file which does something.<br>
<br>
When you build shell scripts with Perl, what you do is open up your
favorite editor and, then, create a file which looks like the following:<br>
<br>
#!/usr/bin/perl<br>
...<br>
<br>
where the ... means a series of lines forming a Perl program. You then
save the file and, using the chmod command, set the permission to
executable by typing <span style="font-weight: bold;">chmod +x
filename.pl</span> (perl files usually end in .pl). If you then put it
in a directory in your home directory
called bin you will be able to use the file like a new command.<br>
<br>
Let's try it out. First, type <span style="font-weight: bold;">cd</span>
to change to your home directory and
type ls -l. See if you have a directory called bin. If not, create it
using the command <span style="font-weight: bold;">mkdir bin </span>and
change into it with <span style="font-weight: bold;">cd bin</span>.<br>
<br>
Then open an appropriate editor and type the following two lines into
the editor.&nbsp; You probably will use nedit
or jedit or gedit or the editor in DrJava or emacs or vi or whatever.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">#!/usr/bin/perl</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">print "Hello, World\n"</span><br>
<br>
and, then, save the file as <span style="font-weight: bold;">Hello.pl</span> in your <span style="font-weight: bold;">bin </span>directory. In your
Shell window, type <span style="font-weight: bold;">pwd </span>to
make sure you are in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">bin </span>directory,
and, then, type <span style="font-weight: bold;">chmod +x Hello.pl.</span>
Then type <span style="font-weight: bold;">cd </span>to return to your home directory. Then you can execute the
program from the command line by typing <span style="font-weight: bold;">Hello.pl</span> at the command line.<br>
<br>
Perl is, in fact, a complete programming language and has things like
loops, conditionals, ... What we are interested in, however, is the
regular expression handling that Perl can do.<br>
<br>
<h2>Reading data from the command line</h2>
The first thing we normally wish to do is read in some information to
be processed. That is fairly easy in Perl. Simply type:<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">$variablename=&lt;STDIN&gt;;</span><br>
<br>
Note two things. First, variable names in Perl are usual variable names
like in Java only preceded by a $ sign. Second, when you read from
standard input you will read everything up to and including a carriage
return. Most of the time you will not want that carriage return so Perl
has a function (Chomp) which will remove it. This means that you will
usually do the following to read in a line of input:<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">$variablename=&lt;STDIN&gt;;</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">chomp($variablename);</span><br>
<br>
(As always, Perl has a shortcut for this. You can actually write
<span style="font-weight: bold;">chomp($variablename=&lt;STDIN&gt;);</span> to do both lines at once.)<br>
<br>
Let's try another example. Edit the file readwrite.pl and enter the
following:<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">#!/usr/bin/perl<br>
while(defined($line=&lt;STDIN&gt;)) {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; print $line;<br>
}<br>
<br>
</span>Save<span style="font-weight: bold;"> readwrite.pl </span>into your <span style="font-weight: bold;">bin</span> directory and, at the command line when in that <span style="font-weight: bold;">bin </span>directory, type <span style="font-weight: bold;">chmod +x readwrite.pl</span> and, then,
after typing <span style="font-weight: bold;">cd</span> to return to your home directory type <span style="font-weight: bold;">readwrite.pl</span> - this will
read in input from the command line until you type a line where you do
&lt;CTRL&gt;-D. Note that it prints out each line you type in.<br>
<br>
A more satisfactory method of the above might be to use an array. In
Perl, a whole array can be referred to using an @ symbol. Thus, for
example, <span style="font-weight: bold;">@thing=(2,3,5);</span> would
make thing an array containing 2,3, and 5 as its values. You could,
then, type <span style="font-weight: bold;">print $thing[1];</span> to
print out 3. An even more amazing thing you can do is type <span style="font-weight: bold;">@lines=&lt;STDIN&gt;;</span>. This will
read in all the lines you type until you type &lt;CTRL-D&gt; for end of
file
and put each line into a position in the array @lines. If you then type
<span style="font-weight: bold;">print</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">$lines[1];</span> it will print out the
second line you typed in! Let's try that by redoing the experiment
above in a new way. Edit readwrite.pl and change it so it looks like
the following.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">#!/usr/bin/perl<br>
@lines=&lt;STDIN&gt;;<br>
foreach $line (@lines) {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; print $line;<br>
}<br>
<br>
</span>Now just type readwrite.pl and, then, type readwrite.pl at the
command line. You should then type in a few lines of text followed by a
carriage return. This should give you all your lines printed out after
the input.<br>
<br>
The line <span style="font-weight: bold;">
@lines=&lt;STDIN&gt;; </span>creates the array lines and, then, adds
lines you type until you do a &lt;CTRL-D&gt;&nbsp; for end of file. The
foreach loop is like the Java for(SomeType x:SomeCollection) which
would run through every element in the collection SomeCollection. <br>
<br>
Note that the $line variable is a dummy variable that takes on the
values <span style="font-weight: bold;">@lines[0], @lines[1], ...</span> in turn inside the<span style="font-weight: bold;"> foreach </span>loop.<br>
<br>
Note also, that each element of <span style="font-weight: bold;">@lines</span> still has that carriage return.
Suppose we didn't want those carriage returns. We could fix that by
using <span style="font-weight: bold;">chomp</span>. Thus:<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">#!/usr/bin/perl<br>
@lines=&lt;STDIN&gt;;<br>
foreach $line (@lines) {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; chomp($line);<br>
}<br>
</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">foreach $line (@lines) {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; print $line;<br>
}<br>
print "\n";<br>
<br>
</span>This will now print the lines together on the same line with the
<span style="font-weight: bold;">print "\n"</span> printing a carriage
return after that line.<br>
<br>
<h2>Regular expressions in Perl</h2>
You can match regular expressions in Perl just like you can on the
command line. (In fact, Perl was designed to use the same regular
expression stuff as the Unix command line so Unix programmers would
have an easy time learning Perl.) The syntax uses two / characters to
surround the regular expression and the =~ operator to return true if
the given string matches the regular expression. For example, suppose
we wanted to match the regular expression ".*aa.*" that we used as our
first example in the previous lab. A Perl program to read in a single
line and match that expression would look like the following. (Note
that the . operator acts like the + in Java for concatenating strings.)<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">#!/usr/bin/perl<br>
$line=&lt;STDIN&gt;;<br>
chomp($line);<br>
if($line =~ /.*aa.*/) {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; print $line . " has an aa\n";<br>
}<br>
else {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; print $line . " has no aa\n";<br>
}<br>
<br>
</span>Try this. Type this into regexp1.pl using your editor, save it,
<span style="font-weight: bold;">chmod +x regexp1.pl,</span> and type <span style="font-weight: bold;">regexp1.pl</span>. Then enter the line<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">aardvark</span><br>
and see what happens. Then run it again and type the line<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">hyena</span><br>
and see what happens.<br>
<br>
Now try the following script for matching a pattern for an entire file:<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">#!/usr/bin/perl<br>
@lines=&lt;STDIN&gt;;<br>
foreach $line(@lines) {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if($line =~ /.*aa.*/) {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; print $line;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>
}<br>
</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
</span>After you have typed it into your editor, saved it as<span style="font-weight: bold;">
regexp2.pl</span> in <span style="font-weight: bold;">bin</span>, and done chmod +x regexp2.pl, try it on the dictionary file
from the last lab by typing:<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">regexp2.pl &lt;
/usr/share/dict/linux.words</span><br>
<br>
from which you should see the same list you got last time.<br>
<br>
<h2>Exercise I:</h2>
<br>
Repeat all of the exercises from last lab by modifying the regular
expression inside your regexp2.pl file to use the new regular
expression.<br>
<br>
<h2>Some more regular expressions</h2>
In addition to the regular expressions we did last time, there are some
other special characters available to do special things. Suppose, for
example, that we wanted to find only words that started with an aa.
Just like last lab, the&nbsp;
^ character handles that. Thus, the expression /^aa.*/ would match only
strings that started with an aa. Also, as before, the $ character would
mark the end of a line. Thus /^t.*t$/ would only match words beginning
and ending with a t. In addition, the [] stuff from the previous lab
works as well. As an example, the following would find words which
start with b, have exactly one s, and end with e. (Note that this
example demonstrates the two uses of ^.)<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">#!/usr/bin/perl<br>
@lines=&lt;STDIN&gt;;<br>
foreach $line(@lines) {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if($line =~ /^b[^s]*s[^s]*e$/) {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; print $line;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>
}<br>
<br>
</span>Now do the following exercises using Perl. Note in 4-9 we mean
two s's and two t's - no more and no less.<br>
<br>
<ol>
  <li>Find all words in /usr/shared/dict/linux.words with exactly two
s's in them.</li>
  <li>Repeat for exactly three s's.</li>
  <li>Repeat for four or fewer s's.</li>
  <li>Find all words with exactly two s's and exactly two t's with the
t's coming after the s's.</li>
  <li>Find all words with exactly two t's and exactly two s's with the
s's coming after the t's.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Find all words with exactly two s's and exactly two t's with the
property that the first s is followed eventually by two t's which are
followed
eventually by one s.</li>
  <li>Find all words with exactly two s's and exactly two t's with the
first s followed eventuallty by one t followed
eventually by one s followed eventually by one t.</li>
  <li>Find all words with exactly two s's and exactly two t's with the
first t followed eventually by two s's followed
eventually by one t.</li>
  <li>Find all words with exactly two s's and exactly two t's with the
first t followed eventually by one s followed
eventually by one t followed eventually by one s.</li>
  <li>Find all words with exactly two s's and exactly two t's. (Note
this is a combination of 4-9).</li>
</ol>
