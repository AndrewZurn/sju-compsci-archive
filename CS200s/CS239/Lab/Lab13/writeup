CS239 ... Lab13  Recurrence relations and inductive proofs

In this lab you are to run some methods which have an integer parameter n,
determine what you think the program does by running the method on several
values of n, and, then,prove your guess is correct using induction. I have
included three Java classes containing the three programs for you to try.

Notice that you will have to try to write down what the functions do as
recurrence relationships.

For example, if I had the function:

int f(int n) {
    if(n==1) return(1);
    else return(n+f(n-1));
}

Then the recurrence would be:

f(1)=1
f(n)=f(n-1)+n

and you would show that f(n)=n(n+1)/2 using induction after discovering
that f(1)=1, f(2)=3, f(3)=6, f(4)=10, f(5)=15

At the next lab, you will be expected to submit the results of your 
test programs and your inductive proofs on a sheet of paper to your
instructor or TA.
