<h1>Lab 11: Recursion and Induction</h1>
<br>
1. Remember good old Fibonacci numbers and their recursive definition?<br>
<br>
f<sub>0 </sub>=
1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; f<sub>1</sub> =
1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; f<sub>n </sub>= f<sub>n-1</sub>
+ f<sub>n-2</sub>&nbsp;&nbsp; (if n&gt;1)<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The claim is that this can be computed by the
following formula:<br>
<br>
f<sub>n</sub> = {[(1+sqrt(5))/2]<sup>n+1</sup>- [(1-sqrt(5))/2]<sup>n+1</sup>}/sqrt(5)<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should create methods to compute each of these
versions and verify that they seem to compute the same thing.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (You can do it in Haskell, Java, Perl, or any other
language you like.)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then prove, inductively, that the second formula is,
in fact, a correct formula. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (The base case in this case is for both 0
and 1.)<br>
<br>
Note this is, in fact, different than what I did in class. There we had
that f0=0 and f1=1.<br>
<br>
2. Now try to show that:<br>
1+x+x<sup>2</sup>+x<sup>3</sup>+...+x<sup>n</sup> = (x<sup>n+1</sup>-
1)/(x-1)<br>
<br>
Do it first by simply writing methods to compute each side of the
equation and comparing
the results and, then,
proving the result inductively.<br>
